# RStudio Open OnDemand app for the main sciCORE cluster

This is based on the app from [Sherlock at Stanford](https://github.com/stanford-rc/sh_ood-apps#sh_rstudio).


## Current status
The app has a very flexible form to request the resources, mainly for testing.

The loaded RStudio-Server module is built with the current default [toolchain](https://docs.easybuild.io/en/latest/Concepts_and_Terminology.html?highlight=toolchains#toolchains)
for sciCORE which is foss/2021, so only R versions that are built with it are shown as available options.
